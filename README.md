# SMTracker

![alt text](http://kayin.moe/smtracker.png "SMTracker")

SMtracker is a simple tracker for Super Metroid, suitable for Metroid Randomizer or 100% playthroughs. It was created with the intent of being used with an ALTTP tracker for playing ALTTP + SM Randomizer.

This is a very quick and fast job made in Scirra Construct Classic. As such it'd almost impossible to make meaningful pull requests, though you can either send me a modified cap or just a screenshot of the changes if they're simple enough.
